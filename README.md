ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raymond! I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. I have hands-on experience building interactive web applications and collaborating on full-stack projects.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm working on NewsExplorer, a dynamic front-end application integrating a third-party news API, and Around The U.S., an engaging photo management web page. I'm also involved in an externship at Expert Event Solutions, where Iâ€™m applying my skills in TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MySQL. Additionally, Iâ€™ve developed a weather-based clothing suggestion app called WTWR and have experience creating custom back-end APIs using Express and MongoDB.

ðŸŽ“ I completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at TripleTen, where I honed my skills in modern web development practices and collaborated on multiple projects with a focus on both front-end and back-end development.

ðŸš€ I'm actively seeking a Front-End Developer internship to further refine my skills and eventually transition into a full-time software engineering role.

ðŸŽ¸ When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing guitar, shooting hoops on the basketball court, or exploring the latest in fashion trends.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to check out my repositories or reach out for collaboration opportunities!
